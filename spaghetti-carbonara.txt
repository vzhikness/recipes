Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook Time: 30 minutes
Total Time: 40 minutes
Ingredients:

1 lb spaghetti
¼ cup heavy cream
4 eggs
½ lb bacon, cut into ½-inch dice
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
2 Tbsp chopped Italian parsley
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
¾ cup freshly grated pecorino-romano cheese (parmesan may be substituted)

Preparation:

Fill a large soup pot with cold water and add a handful or so of Kosher salt. Stir and taste; it should taste like seawater. Cover the pot and heat the water until it boils.

Add the diced bacon to a cold sauté pan and cook slowly over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until crisp. Remove bacon from pan and drain on paper towels.

Drop the spaghetti into the boiling salted water and cook according to package instructions, about 6 to 9 minutes or until al dente, or tender but still firm to the bite.

While the pasta cooks, combine the eggs, cheese, cream and olive oil in a bowl and beat with a whisk until completely mixed.

Drain pasta, toss with the egg and cream mixture, then add the cooked bacon and chopped parsley. Serve right away, with additional grated cheese if desired.
